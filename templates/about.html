                                    As former students, we experienced the beginning-of-semester rush to organize multiple course syllabi and track numerous deadlines across different classes. This tool was born from that experience.

                                    Our goal is to help students, professors, and academic professionals save time and stay organized by automating the extraction of deadlines from course documents.

                                    Our application uses advanced text analysis and pattern recognition to identify assessment deadlines in academic documents. It's specifically designed to extract:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Assignment due dates</li>
                                    <li>Quiz and exam schedules</li>
                                    <li>Project deadlines</li>
                                    <li>Presentation dates</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Once extracted, these dates can be converted to calendar events for your preferred digital calendar.
