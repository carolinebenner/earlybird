Individual assessment.  \nAssessment of \nWriting  Writing skills are not exclusive to English courses and, in fact, should cross all \ndisciplines. The University supports the belief that throughout their University \ncareers, students should be taught how to write well so that when they graduate their \nwritin g abilities will be far above the minimal standards required at entrance. \nConsistent with this belief, students are expected to do a substantial amount of \nwriting in their University courses and, where appropriate, members of faculty can \nand should use wri ting and the grading thereof as a factor in the evaluation of student \nwork. The services provided by the Writing Support, part of the Student Success \nCentre, can be accessed  by all undergraduate and graduate students who feel they \nrequire further assistance.  In this course, your writing will be assessed as part of your \ngrade in the following assessments: class presentation and personal strategy paper.  \nEmail \nCommunication  Please specify the course name and section number in the subject line of all emails  \n(SGMA 672 L01 or SGMA 672 L02) . I will not respond to emails that do not contain this \ninformation.  \nAlthough e mail is commonly used by students to communicate with their instructo rs, \nit does limit the effectiveness of communication  and may not be the best way for me \nto answer student questions . If I feel that communicating via email is not optimal, I \nmay request a telephone call or personal meeting.  \nInternet & \nElectronic \nCommunication \nDevices  \n Please turn OFF your phone before the beginning of each class.  \nStudents are welcome to use laptops and other electronic note -taking devices in \nclasses, however, any surfing of the Internet or use of applications during lectures \nthat is not directly related to the class discussion is distracting and strictly forbidden. \nAdditionally, the use of any electronic devices (e.g., cellular phones/smartphones) for \ne-mailing, text -messaging, etc. is strictly prohibited during class time.  \nPlease respect your fellow students and your instructor and do not disrupt the class \nin any way, including answering cell phone calls, checking email and the Internet on \nany electronic device. It is within my discretion to lower your course grade for \ndistracting the class.  \nPlease note that when I pose a question in class, I do not expect you to look up  the \nanswer \u2013 in fact, you should NOT use your electronic devices during class discussion \ntime , unless it is for taking notes. Class discussion time is typically dedicated to \nthinking, debating and analyzing, not researching (unless otherwise specified).   \nAcademic \nIntegrity and \nRigor  \n Academic integrity and rigor are critical components of a University degree. Academic \nintegrity is the foundation of the development and acquisition of knowledge and is \nbased on values of honesty, trust, responsibility, and respect. The Haskayne School of \nBusiness values ethical leadership and personal integrity, and expects its faculty, staff, \nand students to live these values. In the online environment, certain additional \nmeasures will be put in place to help safeguard the integrity of online assessments \nand the intellectual property of the instructors.  \n\n \n \nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to SGMA 672, L01 & L02, Winter 2025 .

The use of GAI tools must be referenced and cited following these \ncitation instructions .  \n \nWhen using GAI, be mindful of privacy and security issues and bias within the systems. \nAny use of GAI should be to support your own thoughts and not replace individual \nwork, including using GAI to provide peer feedback by uploading others\u2019 work without \ntheir explicit consent.  \n \nThe course facilitator will not upload your work into GAI software without your \nexplicit consent.  \nUse of GAI outside assessment or assignment guidelines or without citation will \nconstitute academic misconduct.  It is the student\u2019s responsibility to be clear on the \nlimitations on the use of generative AI tools for each assessment or assessment, on \nthe expectations for citation and referencing, and on fact checking statements created \nby generative AI tools. If you  are in doubt as to the use of generative AI tools in this \ncourse, please discuss your situation with the course instructor.  \nCourse Outline  \nPart B  The Course Outline Part B contains more generalized information for Haskayne and \nthe University.
