(These articles \nwill be posted on D2L ).  \n  \nIn class, we will engage in a few Case Studies and HR practices to illustrate concepts and apply \nthem to real business situations. Students will need to read and prepare to discuss/engage in \nthese activities before and after each class.  \n \nStudents may use generative AI (GAI) tools in this course in accordance with the instructions \nand guidelines outlined for each  individual  course assignment or assessment.  The use of GAI \ntools must be referenced and cited following these citation instructions .  \n\nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to OBHR 674 .    MMgmt   |    3 \nPlease ensure you review Part B for policies and procedures applicable to all Haskayne graduate  courses.  \n  \nWhen using GAI, be mindful of privacy and security issues and bias within the systems. Any use \nof GAI should be to support your own thoughts and not replace individual work, including using GAI to provide peer feedback by uploading others\u2019 work without the ir explicit consent.  \n \nCourse Workload  \n \n  Tutorials  \n  \nClass \nPreparation Generally, it is understood that students should spend two to three hours per week outside of \nclass time for every hour of lecture.  This means that for each course, students should expect to spend approximately 8 -9 hours per week total on course work and lectures.  This may vary by \nweek depending on both the assessment schedule and on students\u2019 ability to manage their time. The instruction and rubric for the project will be po sted on D2L . \n The course tutorial sessions are scheduled from 8:00 am to 8:50 a. m. for L01 and 13:00- 13:50 \np.m. for L02. During these sessions, students will engage in group work, discussions, and \ncomplete exercises.  \n \nThis class relies heavily on experiential learning. Unlike the traditional lecture method, the \nexperiential learning requires more meaningful involvement of students in the class (but also results in more fun and \u201csticky learning\u201d). You are expected to be an active participant in the \nlearning process. Engaged students devote time and energy to read assigned textbook chapters \nand other reading materials before the class, actively listening to others during class discussions and contributing to class discussi ons. Students are also expected to actively engage in class \ndiscussions over discussion board.   \nPlease Note:  Your instructor may not necessarily cover all the materials in the chapter, but it is \nthe responsibility of the student to understand the concepts presented in the textbook and \nlectures.  Material that can be easily learned by reading the textbook and ass igned articles may \nnot be covered in class. For example, term definitions, facts, and other simple material from the \ntextbook that you can learn on your own by reading the textbook may not be provided in class. However, this material will be co vered on the quizzes. Lectures will focus on the material \npresented in the textbook and general discussion and practices relating to the topic(s) outlined \nin the lecture schedule. If you are unsure of any of the concepts, please take the initiative to ask \nthe instructor during clas s. \n Important information for this class is posted on and communicated through Desire2Learn \n(D2L). Students should regularly check the Announcements section of the course D2L site for ongoing notices.  \n \nGrade Scale  \n \n \n The Haskayne School of Business endeavours to ensure consistency of final grades across \ncourses and sections.  Variations in distribution will always be considered by the instructor \nwhere called for by the performance in each individual class.  The student  does not have any \n\u2018right\u2019 to a certain grade but  is responsible for earning grades.  The instructor has unfettered \ndiscretion to evaluate student performance and assign all grades.  \n \nGrad   Percentag Grade Description  Notes:  \n\nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to OBHR 674 .

I am always \nhappy to assist you in any way I can.  \n  \nClass \nActivities, \nDiscussion,  \nCase \nStudies, exercises,  \nrole plays, \ndiscussion \nboard  \n Throughout the course, you will be encouraged to think creatively about how to use ideas and theories to develop insight about HR practices in organizations. The primary way of doing this is \nduring our class discussions and, in preparation for these discus sions, thinking critically about \nthe relevant readings, and case studies. A ttend  all classes,  be well prepared, and participate \nregularly in class activities and exercises . There will be many opportunities for discussions and \nactivities, and the learning potential comes from everyone\u2019s contributions.  \nStudents are expected to read the assigned text chapters ( and articles , if any)  before class and  \nbe prepared for the class discussion about the topics outlined in the lecture schedule. In each \nclass, students will  work on exercises and cases in groups or individually. Active participation in \neach in class practice is required of all students \u2013  as such, attendance in class is necessary . Each \nexercise will have deliverables (usually written) at the end of the class or tutorial.  Students or \ngroups will comple te these in class assignments and submit or upload the required documents \nunto D2L as evidence of participation at the end of the class  or tutorial. For some of these \nexercises, you'll also participate in peer assessment s, which will enable you to see how fellow \nlearners approached the same challenge and how others viewed your HR solutions.  \nStudents will also participate in the discussions posted on the discussion board. I will provide \nweekly mini -cases and problems related to the HR topic on the discussion board to allow you to \n\nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to OBHR 674 .    MMgmt   |    6 \nPlease ensure you review Part B for policies and procedures applicable to all Haskayne graduate  courses.  \n answer the questions and brainstorm together. You will  brainstorm and collaborate for the \nproblem solving and application of the course concepts.  You will share perspectives and  ideas \nwith the group and ask thoughtful questions in your responses to one another to facilitate a \nrobust  conversation. Provide strong feedback or comments to reach a deeper level of \nunderstanding. Do  not make separate or unrelated posts.     \nAssessment measures for the discussions in class or t he discussion board will include response \nwriting to the exercises  in class  or tutorial opportunities , responses uploaded to D2L, individual \nand group discussions, and the quality of your reply or comments to your peers.  \n \nAssignments  \n Individual Assignment #1 : Case Assignment \u2013 Culture of Diversity  \nStudents will research and develop a 1250- 1500 -word HRM response on how to manage  six \n\u201creal- life\u201d diversity scenarios presented in the assigned case study.  You will research the issues \npresented, providing supporting evidence and rationale for the measures you recommend; you will illustrate the impact your solutions could bring to foster a more inclusive and respectful \nworkplace.  \nIndividual Assignment # 2 : Job Analysis  - The Cornerstone of HR  \nYou will conduct a full job analysis to provide a c ritical review of a current job posting for a real \ncompany.  You will have a choice of a position and level (e.g., entry level; professional level; \nmanager level; \u201cC\u201d Suite level roles).  You will conduct a job analysis for the position (using \nO*NET or NOC)  and two of the various methodologies available for a job analysis  and critique \nthe job posting  You will present your key findings in a  KCAD  analysis framework \u2013 what did \nyou Keep from the original posting (and why); what did you  Change from the original posting \n(and why); what did you  Add in (and why); what did you  Delete (and why)?  You will reconstruct \nthe job posting based on your analysis.  \n \nGroup \nProject  \n  Group Exercises #1:  \nYour group will complete a  series of exercises designed to offer you  practice in HRM . The \nexercises will be largely completed during the tutorial/discussion time frames, although the exercise will be explained and, at times, started /finished during class , usually  the previous \nweek. Your groups will work to complete the exercise during the tutorial and will be submitted \nfollowing the tutorial before the commencement of the class  or by the end of day  of the class in \nthe D2L Drop Box. The instructor will be available for help and coaching during the tutorial. \nWorksheets or templates along wi th scenarios will be provided for the following exercises:  \n1. Policy Development Exercise \n2. Developing a Training Design Plan Exercise  \n3. Job Evaluation Exercise  \n4. Performance Appraisal Exercise  \n5. Grievance Arbitration Exercise   \n6. Safety  Audit Exercise  \n\nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to OBHR 674 .    MMgmt   |    7 \nPlease ensure you review Part B for policies and procedures applicable to all Haskayne graduate  courses.  \n   Group Project #2: Th e Value of HRM (Super 7 Framework)  \nThe Super 7 Framework\u2019s seven categories, present 2 levels of primary responsibility as well as \nthe interactive partnership between the management and the employee. As a group you will  act \nas a consultancy team to prepare,  explain and support with examples and references, the role of \nHuman Resource Management (HRM) in supporting each of these seven categories using the \nconcepts, theories and practices as covered in the course . This assignment can be developed as \na power point with accompanying notes or a paper 2000 -2500 words.  \n You will complete each assignment individually except for the Group Exercises and Group \nProject*. You must use and cite course material ( text, assigned  readings , class material and \ndiscussions) and peer -reviewed academic journals as your primary sources, and, if desired, \nexternal references (blogs, professional newsletters, white papers, opinion pieces, company \nwebsites) no more than 3 0% of total volume of references as a foundation for your analyses \nwithin each of your assignments. APA style is to be used consistently throughout each \nassignment. Instructions and  Rubrics for each assignment are posted in D2L.  \n \n Note: Social loafing is the reduction of individual contributions, at and at times, non -\ncontributing, when people work in groups rather than alone. You will be evaluated on your group\u2019s success for the group project but must have identifiable individual performance indicators for each project . Should one of your team members do not do their fair share of work, \nyour team has an option to conduct a peer review. It is the team\u2019s responsibility to first attempt \nto resolve the matter within the team. Then, if not fully resolved, the team must notify th e \ninstructor of this issue. So that corrective action can be taken before it is too late, please contact \nthe instructor early in the semester. If the matter cannot be resolved to the team\u2019s satisfaction, \nthe team may request the peer evaluation form, which  will be submitted by individual team \nmembers by the last day of regular classes. Peer reviews allow each team member to evaluate \nthe performance of other team members, and the evaluations of your peers could reduce your grade to zero for the team project.  (Peer reviews are not normally done except when someone \nclearly is not doing their fair share of work.)  \n \nAssessment of Writing  Writing skills are not exclusive to English courses and, in fact, should cross all disciplines. The University supports the belief that throughout their University careers, students should be taught how to write well so that when they graduate their writin g abilities will be far above the \nminimal standards required at entrance. Consistent with this belief, students are expected to do \na substantial amount of writing in their University courses and, where appropriate, members of \nfaculty can and should use wri ting and the grading thereof as a factor in the evaluation of \nstudent work. The services provided by the Writing Support, part of the Student Success Centre, can be accessed  by all undergraduate and graduate students who feel they require further \nassistance.  In this course, your writing will be assessed as part of your grade in the following \nassessments:  \n 1. Individual Assignment # 1: Culture of Diversity  \n2. Individual Assignment #2: Job Analysis  \n\nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to OBHR 674 .

Written submissions of group  exercises  \n5. Group Project # 2: Value of HRM (Super 7 Framework)  \n  \nEmail \nCommunication Please specify the course name and section number in the subject line of all emails OBHR 674. I will not respond to emails that do not contain this information.  \nAlthough e mail is commonly used by students to communicate with their instructo rs, it does \nlimit the effectiveness of communication  and may not be the best way for me to answer student \nquestions . If I feel that communicating via email is not optimal, I may request a telephone call or \npersonal meeting.  \nInternet & \nElectronic \nCommunication Devices  \n During this class students will have the opportunity to utilize their personal electronic devices as \nlearning tools to facilitate certain class activities. If your cell phone, tablet, or laptop does not \nbecome a distraction, it is fine for you to use it in class. I reserve the right to request that you put the device away if it is being used for activities unrelated to the class.  \nAcademic Integrity and Rigor  \n Academic integrity and rigor are critical components of a University degree. Academic integrity is the foundation of the development and acquisition of knowledge and is based on values of honesty, trust, responsibility, and respect. The Haskayne School of Business values ethical leadership and personal integrity, and expects its faculty, staff, and students to live these values. In the online environment, certain additional measures will be put in place to help safeguard the \nintegrity of online assessments and the intellectual property of the instructors.  \n  \nCourse Outline  \nPart B  The Course Outline Part B contains more generalized information for Haskayne and the University.
