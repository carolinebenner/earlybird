Topics include  financial markets and instruments, valuation of \nassets and projects under certainty and  uncertainty, development of portfolios, corporate \nfinancing policy and financial risk management.   \nCourse Objectives  \n The objective of this second  course is not to make you a financial specialist.  As with FNCE \n672, the focus  is on understanding the financial issues and alternatives  available and \nlearning only the most basic analytical tools for dealing with them. We will continue to \nemphasize three financial implications of every decision that is made : profitability, \nfinancing needs, and risk.  By the end of this course, students will  be able to:  \n1. Identify, calculate, and evaluate appropriate measures of risk for various investments \nand portfolios of investments  \n2. Evaluate a corporate investment opportunity and a firm\u2019s capital structure  \n3. Contrast the main capital allocation opportunities available to a corporate manager \n4. Value various financial investments and transactions  \n5. Critique a firm\u2019s governance ecosystem and make recommendations  \n6. Navigate an ethical dilemma in a finance context  \nTextbook and/or \nOther Materials  We will use one chapter from the Higgins, Koski, Mitton (RH), Analysis for Financial \nManagement, 13th edition, McGraw -Hill/Irwin, New York, 2 023. You may find it useful to \nreread certain sections of the chapters used in FNCE 672.  \n\n\nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to FNCE 67 4, L01 and L02 , W2 5, Q4 .   MMgmt   |    2 \nPlease ensure you review Part B for policies and procedures applicable to all Haskayne MMgmt  courses.  \n Required cases are  posted on D2L . Any s upplementary  readings can be a ccess ed through \nthe University Library or directly from HBR (3 free articles ). \nClass Preparation \n& Desire2Learn (D2L)  Class will be most beneficial when you come prepared and are prepared to contribute. \nClasses cover the concepts and financial theory while the cases help you to use those concepts to develop a coherent and defensible solution. Issues in business are rarely black \nand white, and they rarely are limited to one specific problem.  \nYour willingness to participate will enhance your learning and the learning of others. If there is not a willingness to participate, be prepared for \u201ccold calling.\u201d We discuss \nmanagerial incentives and cold calling can be a great way to incentivize prepara tion.  \nPlease attend each class, arrive on time, and minimize disruptions \u2013  in business, poor  \nbehaviour would not be tolerated for any length of time or with any degree of frequency.  \nImportant information and additional readings are posted on D2L.  \nYour instructor may not \nnecessarily cover all of the materials in the module , it is your r esponsibility to understand \nthe concepts presented in the materials assigned and lectures. If you are unsure of any of \nthe concepts, please take the initiative to ask the instructor during clas s. \nCourse Workload  \n Generally, it is understood that students should spend two hours per week outside of \nclass time for every hour of lecture.  Students should expect to spend approximately 9-10 \nhours  per week on each course  (doing work and attending lectures ). This may vary by \nweek depending on both the assessment schedule and on your  ability to manage time.  \nGrade Scale  \n \n  The Haskayne School of Business endeavours to ensure consistency of final grades across \ncourses and sections. Variations in distribution will always be considered by the instructor where called for by the performance in each individual class. The student d oes not have \nany \u2018right\u2019 to a certain grade, but is responsible for earning grades. The instructor has unfettered discretion to evaluate student performance and assign all grades.  \nGrade   Percentage \nScore  Grade \nPoint \nValue  Description  Approx. \nDistribution in \nclass : \nA+ \u2265 95.0  4.0 Outstanding /exceptional \nperformance  Up to 20 % A \u2265 90.0  4.0 \nA- \u2265 85.0  3.7 Consistent, very high quality work  30-50% \nB+ \u2265 80.0  3.3 Good performance  \n30-50% B \u2265 75.0  3.0 Basic competence  \nB- \u2265 70.0  2.7 Marginal performance, defined as \nhaving gaps in basic competence  \nUp to 10%  C+ \u2265 65.0  2.3 All grades below B - are indicative of \nfailure at the graduate level and \ncannot be counted toward the \ncourse requirements.  C \u2265 60.0  2.0 \nF \u2265 0% 0 \nNote: See the \u201c Academic Standing \u201d section of the Faculty of Graduate Studies Calendar regarding grades less than B -. \nThere is no requirement to pass any particular component  in order to pass the course. \nThere are no \u201cdo -overs\u201d or additional work for extra grades in this course.  \nWhile I am  sympathetic to students who are close to a particular cut off point, for the \nsame reason someone who gets 90. 01 will not have their \"A\" grade removed, someone \nwho gets 89.99 will not be \"bumped up\" to an \"A\" grade.

Typically, deferrals are only granted in cases of illness, domestic affliction, or religious conviction, and are entirely at the discretion of the instructor. If a deferral is granted, the instructor will require a make -up \nassessment to be completed.  \nLate Policy  Late assignments  will be subject to a penalty of 50 % per  full or partial day, including \nweekends and holidays. A n assignment submitted two  or more days after the due date \nwill not be graded and the student will be assigned a grade of 0% . Turning in an in -class \nassignment late will result in a grade of zero.  \nClass Participation & In Class \nExercises  \n Each class period has at least one graded in -class assignment/exercise. You may be asked \nto complete these individually or as a group.  \nThere are no grades for class participation but constructive involvement and contribution \nto class discussion is encouraged. In the future, you will need to be able to converse with \npotential investors and management.  \nCase Write Up  \n Case write -ups are due PRIOR to the beginning of the class in which the case will be \ndiscussed. Pay attention to the instruction sheet for the case, most often you will need to \nsubmit HARD COPY (this means electronic submissions will NOT be accepted).  \nValuation Quiz  This will be a valuation problem requiring you to evaluate a project that a company is considering. Further details for preparation, including resources allowed, will be given in \nthe March 4  class session.  \nQuizzes  \n Are individual, closed book, no additional resource s allowed . The final quiz will be \ncomprehensive, details for preparation will be given in the April 1 session.  \n\nThis is Part A of the course outline, which is specific to FNCE 67 4, L01 and L02 , W2 5, Q4 .   MMgmt   |    4 \nPlease ensure you review Part B for policies and procedures applicable to all Haskayne MMgmt  courses.  \n Assessment of \nWriting  Writing skills are not exclusive to English courses and, in fact, should cross all disciplines. The University supports the belief that throughout their University careers, students should be taught how to write well so that when they graduate their writin g abilities will \nbe far above the minimal standards required at entrance. Consistent with this belief, \nstudents are expected to do a substantial amount of writing in their University courses \nand, where appropriate, members of faculty can and should use wri ting and the grading \nthereof as a factor in the evaluation of student work. The services provided by the Writing Support, part of the Student Success Centre, can be accessed  by all undergraduate and \ngraduate students who feel they require further assistance.  In this course, any items \nrequiring writing will be assessed as part of your grade.  \nTutorials  Please see the course schedule . \nActivities Outside of Class Time  I expect students to engage in team building activities with their group members and cohort in general. P lease make plans to meet your classmates for a walk, a coffee, an \nactivity. Feel free to invite me too.  \nEmail Communication  Please specify the course name and section number at the beginning , or start , of the \nsubject line of all emails (FNCE 67 4 L01 or FNCE 67 4 L02).  I do not respond to emails that \ndo not contain this information. I usually respond to within two business days.  \nAlthough e mail is commonly used by students to communicate with their instructo rs, it \ndoes limit the effectiveness of communication  and may not be the best way for me to \nanswer student questions . If I feel that communicating via email is not optimal, I may \nrequest a telephone call or personal meeting.   \nInternet & Communication \nDevices  You should try to minimize distractions by not  surfing of the Internet during lectures  and \nusing any electronic devices (e.g., cellular phones/smartphones) for non -class purposes . \nIndividuals distracting others (including the instructor) will be asked to leave the class.  \nAcademic Integrity and Rigor  \n Academic integrity and rigor are critical components of a University degree. Academic integrity is the foundation of the development and acquisition of knowledge and is based on values of honesty, trust, responsibility, and respect. The Haskayne School of Business values ethical leadership and personal integrity, and expects its faculty, staff, and students \nto live these values.  Certain additional measures will be put in place to help safeguard the \nintegrity of online assessments and the intellectual proper ty of the instructors.  \nAttendance and \nEngagement  \n Active engagement in class and with course material is essential in any course. Whether \nwe are in person, or in an on -line environment , students must take increased ownership \nof their learning.  \nIf it appears that you are not actively engaged in the class (for example, not responding to the instructor, not joining discussion groups , etc.), your instructor reserves the right to ask \nyou to leave the class or session.   \nCourse Outline  \nPart B  The Course Outline Part B contains more generalized information for Haskayne and \nthe University.
